1. Receive events in correct format
- Event cannot be NULL or Integer
- Normal events and updates: Plane ID, Plane Model, Origin, Destination, Event Type, Timestamp, Fuel Delta
- Remove event: Plane ID, Timestamp

2. Display Plane ID, Flight Status, Last known fuel level flight at any given point in time

3. Alter fuel levels e.g. could receive -324, must take it as a subtraction

4. Remove events that match the plane id and timestamp received

5. Convert timestamp to epoch so that its easier to find the most recent event depending on time X

6. Calculate shortest distance between timestamp given and each plane's most recent event timestamp X

7. Change event names depending on the event given e.g. if given re-fuel,
assume that in one hour the plane is 'Awaiting-Takeoff'
